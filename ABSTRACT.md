Authors introduce **SignverOD**, a curated dataset of 2576 scanned document images with 7103 bounding box annotations, across 4 categories (*signature*, *initials*, *redaction*, *date*). SignverOD cover a diverse set of document types including memos, emails, bank cheques, lease agreements and letters, memos, invoices. Detecting the presence and location of hand written artifacts such as signatures, dates, initials can be critical for scanned (offline)document processing systems. This capability can support multiple downstream tasks such as signature verification, document tagging and categorization.
